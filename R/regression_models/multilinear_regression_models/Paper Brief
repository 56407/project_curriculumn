This is an assignment that goes through entire process of research.

First we have to guess and found the potential variables that may influence Gini Index.
Then do research on academic papers and check if there's any supporting evidence. 
After that, data are collected and downloaded from World Bank http://data.worldbank.org

The final report includes:

1. Executive Summary: short paragraph summarizing the paper
2. Introduction: define the Gini index and the purpose of the study
3. Data: 10 explanatory variables and the reason, with relevant descriptive summary
4. Methods: relevant plots; 
            model building summary (transformations, variable selection, collinearity, etc.); 
            check regression assumptions; 
            model evaluation;
            relevant hypothesis tests (include hypotheses, test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, alpha and conclusion)
5. Discussion: final regression model; 
               interpretation of model; 
               discussion of usefulness of model; 
               any improvement idea
